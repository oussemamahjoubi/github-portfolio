## üìñ Overview

This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, built to highlight my professional experience, skills, projects, and services as a Software Engineering graduate. The site is designed with a clean, modern aesthetic using Bootstrap 5, ensuring responsiveness across devices. It serves as a central hub for potential employers, collaborators, and clients to explore my work in DevSecOps, AI-driven solutions, data automation, and more.

**Key highlights**:
- **DevSecOps Expertise**: Automated vulnerability analysis with a 40% efficiency gain using tools like Snyk, Jenkins, and AI models.
- **AI Integration**: Developed conversational chatbots with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Qwen.
- **Full-Stack Proficiency**: Projects in Angular, FastAPI, Spring Boot, and microservices architectures.

The template is based on [MyResume by BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/), customized for my content.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Sections**: Navigate seamlessly through Home, About, Skills, Resume, Services, and Contact.
- **Skills Visualization**: Progress bars for key competencies like Python (95%), DevSecOps (90%), and Power BI (90%).
- **Resume Download**: Direct link to my CV in PDF format.
- **Contact Form**: Integrated with Formspree for easy messaging (with loading, success, and error feedback).
- **Animations & Effects**: Powered by AOS for smooth fade-ins and Typed.js for dynamic text.
